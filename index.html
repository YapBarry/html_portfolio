    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>My interest in using data and machine learning to solve real-world problems was sparked when I realized certain industrial inefficiencies could be optimized with data-driven insights. I have 4 years of Domain Expertise in Supply Chain and Demand Forecasting and I have recently completed the AI apprenticeship programme under AISG. I am familiar with the usual deep learning tools and frameworks i.e. Scikit-learn and frameworks i.e. Tensorflow and Pytorch. I also have experience in basic web (HTML, CSS and Javascript) development and have worked on Linux softwares, and on development boards such as Jetson Nano. I am a self-motivated learner and seek to better the lives of people and businesses through technologies.</p>
